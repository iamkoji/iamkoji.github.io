This is a personal website, credits below, I decided to add on more features to make it more modern.

Additions:

- "Click to enter!" type of transition with a smooth fade.
- On click, it will play music because I like it.
- Added a rainbow animation that I used for links.
- Added "Ative Developer Badge" and "Originaly Known As" Since the original one din't have it.
